**Project Overview**

This project is a C program that models lighting in an outdoor car park, evaluating light intensity from multiple lighting towers to ensure adequate coverage across all areas.

**Stages:**

1. Read and Display Lighting Data
- Reads car park boundaries and lighting tower details, displaying the setup information for verification.

2. Grid Analysis for Light Coverage
- Evaluates light levels at points on a grid and calculates areas falling below the minimum illuminance requirement.

3. Lighting Map Visualization
- Creates a character-based map showing lighting levels across the car park, identifying dark areas.

4. Low-Light Region Detection
- Identifies and counts contiguous low-light areas where additional towers may be required.

This program emphasizes struct arrays, incremental program development, and clear program design.
